# Steps involved in making the model 
1) Importing our data. <br>
2) Data Augmentation.<br>
3) Model Building. <br>
4) Flattening and Adding Dense Layers. <br>
5) Using vgg19 Tranfer learning techniques.<br>
6) Passing it into the gradio app
7) Concluding our analysis by testing the model with some random user input.<br>

# Result  
The Model with the help of gradio is able to make a decent prediction in which class a particular gemstone belongs to. <br>
