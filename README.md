Dataset Link - https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18/gemstones-images
This dataset contains 3,200+ images of different gemstones. The images are grouped into 87 classes which are already divided into train and test data. All images are in various sizes and are in .jpeg format.

# Objectives  
The objective is to predict to which class a particular gemstone belongs. <br>

# Steps involved in making the model 
1) Importing our data. <br>
2) Checking for null values and finding mean of different columns, their min and max values, and getting information about different columns of our data.<br>
3) Visualizing our data in order to find out the best columns to use as features for our model. <br>
4) Make a copy of original data to make the changes and seperate out the columns that we will use as our features. <br>
5) Feeding these features to three different Models i.e. Logistic Regression, KNN and SVM to get the best results.<br>
6) Concluding our analysis by testing the model with some random user input.<br>

# Result  
The Model were able to make a decent prediction about whether a person will be placed or not. Out of the three, Logistic Regression gave us the best results. These models cann still be improved to make more accurate predictions. <br>
